            <h3>The Future Is Now</h3>
            <p>The city's made of diamonds<br>
                And tomorrow glass will grow<br>
                All the freedoms that divide us<br>
                They're coming after me<br>
                Flashback nineteen eighty four<br>
                Now who's knock, knocking at your door?<br>
                A thought that starts a riot<br>
                They're coming after me<br>
                Now, life is not the same<br>
                I am one, but sparks turn into flames<br>
                Will you take what's in my head<br>
                And erase me when I'm dead<br>
                Cause the future is now<br>
                Now I'm disappearing<br>
                The day has turned to night<br>
                Can you save me from the light?<br>
                Cause the future is here<br>
                This is how I disappear<br>
                Running down a spiral<br>
                With the light of better men<br>
                Shouting progress is survival<br>
                Take one last look and see me<br>
                Now you see me, now you don't<br>
                No valid break, no string of hope<br>
                My hero your pariah<br>
                They're coming after me<br>
                Now, life is just God's game<br>
                I am one<br>
                But sparks turn into flames<br>
                And you get what you deserve<br>
                When revenge is what you serve<br>
                Cause the future is now<br>
                Now I'm disappearing<br>
                I sink into the night<br>
                And I'm turning off the lights<br>
                Cause the future is here<br>
                This is how I disappear<br>
                So the end's when you make that<br>
                And that's what your looking for<br>
                This is the future<br>
                Future is now<br>
                Disappear<br>
                Disappear<br>
                I disappear<br>
                Disappear<br>
                Now turn off the lights<br>
                The skys are blue inside you<br>
                Turn off the lights<br>
                They'll get inside of you<br>
                Will you take what's in my head<br>
                And erase me when I'm dead<br>
                Cause the future is now<br>
                Now I'm disappearing<br>
                The day has turned to night<br>
                Can you save me from the light?<br>
                Cause the future is here<br>
                This is how I disappear<br>
                Disappear<br>
                Disappear<br>
                Disappear</p>

            <h3>All I Have Left Is You</h3>
            <p>I’ll be the one, spin me around<br>
                Lifting you up, and holding me down<br>
                Inside a storm is raging, it blows up in your eyes<br>
                Inside a heart is breaking, rivers running dry<br>
                I could run, I could hide<br>
                When I’m crashing down who’s the one who saves me?<br>
                Oh, intertwined, wrap around me with your thorns<br>
                And we’re holding on<br>
                When there’s nothing left to hold on to<br>
                So don’t tell me when it’s gone<br>
                'Cause all I have left is you<br>
                (All I have left is you)<br>
                Out of love, out of time<br>
                When I’m falling down you’re the one who saves me<br>
                Oh, intertwined, wrap around me now with your thorns<br>
                And we’re holding on<br>
                When there’s nothing left to hold on to<br>
                So don’t tell me when it’s gone<br>
                'Cause all I have left is you<br>
                (All I have left is you)<br>
                When there’s nothing left to hold on to<br>
                So don’t tell me when it’s gone<br>
                'Cause all I have left, all I have left is you<br>
                I’ll be the one lifting you up again<br>
                Inside a storm is raging, hold me down, hold me down<br>
                Yeah yeah yeah<br>
                Lying here waiting, lying here waiting<br>
                Lying here waiting for<br>
                And we’re holding on<br>
                When there’s nothing left to hold on to<br>
                So don’t tell me when it’s gone<br>
                'Cause all I have left is you<br>
                (All I have left is you)<br>
                When there’s nothing left to hold on to<br>
                So don’t tell me when it’s gone<br>
                'Cause all I have left, all I have left is you<br>
                'Cause all I have left, all I have left is you<br>
